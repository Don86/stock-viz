# stock-viz
Visualization of stock data using Python Flask. 

The trappings of a stock visualization front-end, powered by Python, displayed using `Bokeh` and `Flask` libraries. We'll see the pertinent statistics of a selection of stocks - mostly index ETFs and blue chips - that I have personal interest in. New features can be added incrementally as this project increases in scope.
