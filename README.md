# stock-viz
Visualization of stock data using Python Flask. 

The trappings of a stock visualization front-end, powered by Python (Django).  The data are extracted using a Yahoo finance API. We'll see the pertinent statistics of a selection of stocks - mostly index ETFs and blue chips - that I have personal interest in. New features can be added incrementally as this project increases in scope. 

Planned features:
* Pick an X year range of historical data, for a particular ticker symbol
* Purchase of $Y worth of this stock at regular intervals. Selling is not an option.
* Return histo of returns, for all possible ranges of length X years.
